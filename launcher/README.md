# AoS2 Launcher
The launcher is a standalone application that can be installed on a client's computer, to make starting the client program easier. Since the client boots up and directly connects to a server via command-line arguments, everything before that is managed by the launcher, like finding a server, choosing a nickname, etc.

This is a JavaFX application.
